  description: "I focus on practical software development, automation, and system reliability. I enjoy building tools that simplify workflows and exploring new technologies through experimentation. In my spare time, I design and 3D print mechanical parts, stay active through fitness, and try new sports. I prefer early-morning work sessions and continuous self-improvement through projects and open-source collaboration.",
